         <button id="eric" class='person-chooser'>Eric</button>
         <button id="jessica" class='person-chooser'>Jessica</button>

         <button id="dawn" class='person-chooser'>Dawn</button>

          <p id='dawn-text' class='center-text'>
            Dawn was born blind, no getting around it. But because she was born that way it didn't really bother her all too much, if she couldn't do anything about it then why bother worrying.<br>
            Despite her disability she was fiercely independent, she refused to let herself be a burden to others.<br>
            She wouldn't even let her dad drive her home from school, better yet her new step-mom. She lived close enough though so they didn't worry much.<br>
            Dawn was a stubborn person, it would take something rather drastic for her to changer her ways.<br>
          </p>

          <p id='robert-text' class='center-text'>
            Robert lived a very plain life, he was as normal as you can get. The monotony of his job and the consistency of his lifestyle, while soulcrushing to some, was empowering to him.<br>
            If there was anything remotely off about him it would probably be his hobby.<br>
            Robert was a stalker.<br>
            Every month he would choose a different person, and then invest a considerable amount of his spare time that month keeping regular and detailed tabs on them.<br>
            It was nothing perverted or anything like that, he simply liked the thrill of it. The power he felt knowing that he could do anything to them if he so wished.<br>
            But Robert never acts on his investigations.<br>
            Why would he?<br>
          </p>

          <p id='sam-text' class="center-text">
            Sam grew up in a deeply religious but fairly progressive Christian community. As a result Sam has a very strong sense of right and wrong, her morals are uncompromisable.<br>
            Sam's the type of person who would not hesitate to put herself in danger if it meant saving somebody else.<br>
            So you can imagine the agonizing guilt she felt after the accident.<br>
            'It's not your fault' - 'It could have happened to anybody' - 'There's nothing you could have done'<br>
            None of these words comforted her, if anything they further depressed her.<br>
            Every time she closes her eyes she can see it. The man's face as her car hit him. The screech of the tires. The scream of the girl she swerved to avoid.<br>
          </p>

          <p id='ben-text' class='center-text'>
            Ben's a cool guy, I would choose somebody else.
          </p>

          <p id='jessica-text' class='center-text'>
            Jessica had only one reason for moving to America, money. Raised in a small village in the Philippines, her parents could barely afford to eat better yet pay for her nursing school tuition.<br>
            With the hefty debt hanging over her head and the recent news that her father had ALS, Jessica decided to rush to America, stay at her aunt Mel's place, and find a job as fast as she could.<br>
            Jessica believed that all she had to do was find a job in america and all of her problems would be solved. She can help support her family and then some!<br>
            Without her, how could her parents pay off that tuition? Without her, how could they possibly afford the inevitable medical bills for her father?<br>
            Jessica was her parent's pride and joy<br>
            Without her, how could her parents go on?<br>
          </p>

          <p id='eric-text' class='center-text'>
            Eric just started his first year of highschool. After his parent's divorce Eric was forced to follow his mother and move from his home town in Michigan to a small town in North Dakota.<br>
            The cliques at North Valley Highschool have long since been forged and Eric's cynical nature coupled with his anti-social tendencies made him somewhat of a natural outcast.<br>
            With no friends to speak of and no will to engage in any meaningful activities everyday was a miserable experience for Eric and his mother was far too tired working two jobs trying to support them to even notice.<br>
            Go to school alone. Take classes alone. Eat lunch in a bathroom stall alone. Go home alone. Eat dinner alone.<br>
            Alone. Alone. Alone. Alone.<br>
            Every night Eric lays on his bed and thinks to himself "Perhaps this world would be better off without me."<br>
            And perhaps it would be.<br>
